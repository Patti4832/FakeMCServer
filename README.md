- You can now start "start.bat" or "start.sh" scripts if someone tries to join (simply add the start script to the same directory)

Original Readme
=======
A Fake MinecraftServer, that shows the following messages:
* motd
* version
* maxplayers
* playerlist
* kickmessage<br />
You can customize all messages.

Compile the .jar or download the compiled version here: https://mega.co.nz/#!ad1AUCKD!IDdb8dw8hCcy_r0InkkBK58OOEEuVEv_gNGt-L__QVk<br />
then open cmd, goto the folder that contains the file (with cd), and run it with:<br />
java -jar FakeMCServer.jar -ip localhost -port 25565<br />
(you can change the ip and port)<br />
<br />

you can use color codes with '&' (for example "&4I'm Red!")<br />
you can make new lines with '\n' for multiline motd, the playerlist and the kickmessage<br />
you can use unicode: if you want to use special charakters, the convert to JavaScript Escapes (http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/)<br />

Have fun ;)
